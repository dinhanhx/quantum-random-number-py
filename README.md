## Introduction

A simple (totally native) Python 3 API for [ANU QRNG API](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/contact/api-documentation/). 

## Which functions **are** available?

For each function exists in [ANU QRNG API](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/contact/api-documentation/), there is a Python function.

## Which functions are **not** available?

They are [ANU QRNG]'s live numbers functions. In order to have Python functions, one might need to use [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [beautifulsoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). I will **not** implement those because I don't know ANU allows us to scrap. 

## Note

- **Do not** use this code for cryptography implementation.
